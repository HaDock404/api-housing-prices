Here is my API using FastAPI which provides a simple and powerful interface to estimate the price of your house based on its characteristics.   

## Description  

The objective of this project is mainly GitOps oriented. This project is stored on a Gitlab server that I created with different levels of user management and complete project configuration in order to streamline and secure the creation process. This server has a runner allowing you to carry out numerous automations using pipelines in order to carry out CI/CD of the project.
